COVID 19 Detection - Pytorch Tutorial
In this notebook, I am going to train a CNN classifier. For that we need dataset from both classes, I used the dataset from two sources,

Cohen's COVID Chest X-ray Dataset: https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset
Paul Mooney's Chest X-ray Dataset (Pneumonia): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
